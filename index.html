            <p class="about">
                In a little over 1 year, my team and I successfully developed the basic version of the low-code BPM platform on the stack: .NET 6, Postgresql / MS SQL (Codefirst), reactjs + redux + Material UI, Onlyoffice, bpmn.io, storybook , redis, ELK, docker.
                Conceptual architecture, technology stack, dynamic data model, system requirements, UI/UX were developed directly by me.

                Previously worked as an architect and developer on SharePoint, architecture of classic web applications, project & delivery management, recruitment, mentoring. Software and hardware sizing solutions. Designed and coded the first versions of the company's boxed product.
                Over the years, I coded in T-SQL, P-SQL, .NET Forms, ASP.NET.
                At first, I deployed the entire stack of technologies for the needs of the office and project development: Team Foundation Server, Active Directory, DNS, SharePoint, network, S4B, Exchange.

                Despite the fact that I am a product owner of a low-code platform, I know how technologies work from the inside, I communicate with developers, QA, DevOps and analysts in the same language, as this is required by the specifics of the product that my team is developing.
